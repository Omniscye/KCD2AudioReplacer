🎵 Modding Music into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
Using KCD2AudioReplacer by Omiscye

What You Need First
Download the SQBC Editor:
https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/414

Quick Overview (For the ADHD crew)
Get the SQBC files you want to change from music.pak in the game files.

Put those somewhere easy to find.

Open SQBC Editor, extract the .ogg files from the .sqbc.
Grab whatever music you want to use as a replacement (MP3, OGG, or WAV – doesn’t matter).
Download my program in releases on Github or on NexusMods (KCD2AudioReplacer).

In the app:
Select the folder with the original .ogg files you just extracted.
Select your custom music track.
Choose an output folder.
Hit Start.

⚠️ Heads-up:
My tool will randomly cut parts of your chosen song and fit it into each .ogg file's original time limit.
The timing is defined by the original .wdsh file – we don’t touch that.

What's Happening Under the Hood
So you're not sitting there wondering “WTF is this app doing?” – here’s the basic idea:

It reads all the original .ogg files and figures out how long each one is.
Then it takes your chosen song and slices random segments of it to fit the same durations.
It uses FFmpeg in the background (via pydub) to do all the slicing and converting.
You’ll see some CMD windows flash – that’s normal, that’s just FFmpeg doing its thing.

After It’s Done
Open SQBC Editor again.
Hit File > New.

Add your new .ogg files one at a time, in the exact same order (use “Sort by name” in Windows Explorer to help).
Save your new .sqbc somewhere.
Rename it to match the original .sqbc you were replacing.
Put it back into the correct mod structure, just like any other mod.

Important Notes
I’m not explaining how to make a mod or set up the folder structure or pack a .pak file.
If you don’t know that part, join the KCD2 Modding Discord – we’ve got you.

Make sure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH.
If it’s not, the tool won’t work. Google “how to add FFmpeg to PATH” if you’re stuck.

Done?
✅ Drop it in your Mods folder, pack it if needed, run the game.
✅ Enjoy your custom music.
🍿 And yeah, grab some snacks.
